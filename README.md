## Basic Overview

iTrAlytics is an Interactive Web Analytics Dashboard developed in node.js, express, React and more cutting-edge technologies (see Technologies section below).

It uses OAuth to sign in users with their Google account and uses their Google Analytics account data to present the charts in the dashboard and display the currently active users in real time (almost*).

<small>* Almost real time feedback, due to Google Real Time API limitations. We query the API every 15sec. There is a max quote limit for: 4000 queries / day</small>
